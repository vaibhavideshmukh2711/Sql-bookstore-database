# Sql-bookstore-database
A simple SQL-based Bookstore Database containing three tables: Books, Customers, and Orders. The project demonstrates basic CRUD operations, relational table design, and real-world querying for managing book purchases and customer details.

 
## Overview
The Book Management System is designed to manage and track books, customers, and orders efficiently. This project demonstrates the use of SQL queries to perform data retrieval, aggregation, and analysis on a relational database. It allows tracking of inventory, monitoring customer behavior, analyzing sales, and calculating revenue and stock levels. The system can be used by bookstores or libraries to optimize operations and make data-driven decisions.

## The project contains three main tables:

- books
- customers
- orders

- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite)
- Database Management
- Data Analysis

## Insights from Data Analysis
- From executing the SQL queries, several key insights can be drawn:
- Popular Genres and Authors: Identifying which genres and authors have the highest sales helps in inventory planning.
- Customer Behavior: Customers who place multiple orders or spend more than a certain threshold can be targeted for   promotions.
- Revenue Analysis: Calculating total revenue and identifying top-selling books assists in strategic pricing and marketing.
